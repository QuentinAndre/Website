My research focuses on judgment and decision making in general, with a special interest in consumer 
financial decision-making, numerical cognition, and probabilistic reasoning. I also care about open-science, replicability, and reproducibility.


On this website, I share a summary of my current projects and publications, tools and software that I have
 programmed, and occasional thoughts and tutorials on various research-related topics.
