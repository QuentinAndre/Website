abstract: "Food products claim to be healthy in many ways, but prior research has investigated these claims at either 
the macro level (using broad descriptions such as “healthy” or “tasty”) or the micro level (using single claims such as 
“low fat”). The authors use a meso-level framework to examine whether these claims invoke natural or scientific 
arguments and whether they communicate about positive attributes present in the food or negative attributes absent 
from the food. They find that common front-of-packaging claims can be appropriately classified into (1) science- and 
absence-focused claims about “removing negatives,” (2) science- and presence-focused claims about “adding positives,” 
(3) nature- and absence-focused claims about “not adding negatives,” and (4) nature- and presence-focused claims about 
“not removing positives.” The authors conduct validation studies using breakfast cereals, a category for which 
nutrition quality varies but food claims are constant. They find that claim type is completely uncorrelated to
 actual nutrition quality yet influences inferences consumers make about taste, healthiness, and dieting. Claim type 
 also helps predict the effects of hedonic eating, healthy eating, or weight loss goals on food choice."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Consumers intuitively categorize front-of-packaging claims  displayed on food into 4 
broad categories: (1) Claims about “removing negatives,” (2) claims about “adding positives,” (3) claims about “not adding 
negatives,” and (4) claims about “not removing positives.” Each type of claim is associated with different beliefs
about the healthiness, tastiness, and dieting properties of the food."
