abstract: "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and data analytics are facilitating the automation of some consumer chores (e.g., in smart homes and in self-driving cars) and allow the emergence of big-data-driven, micro-targeting marketing practices (e.g., personalized content recommendation algorithms). We contend that those developments can generate a tension for marketers, consumers, and policy makers: They can, on the one hand, contribute to consumer well-being by making consumer choices easier, more practical, and more efficient. On the other hand, they can also undermine consumers’ sense of autonomy, the absence of which can be detrimental to consumer well-being. Drawing on diverse perspectives from marketing, economics, philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, we explore how consumers’ sense of autonomy in making choices affects their well-being. We discuss how new technologies may enhance or diminish consumers’ perceptions of being in control of their choices and how either of those can, in turn, enhance of detract from consumer well-being. Building on this, we identify open research questions in the domain of choice, well-being, and consumer welfare, and suggest avenues for future research."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In this summary of a Choice Symposium session, we explore the opportunities and challenges that the 
development of automation and artificial intelligence pose to consumers. They can, on the one hand, contribute to 
consumer well-being by making choices easier, more practical, and more efficient. On the other hand, they can also 
undermine consumers' sense of autonomy, the absence of which is detrimental to well-being. Drawing from diverse 
perspective, we explore the relevance and importance of autonomy to consumers, and identify open research questions 
in this domain."
