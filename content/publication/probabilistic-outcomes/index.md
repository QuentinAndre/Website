abstract: "Most theories of decision-making under risk assume that payoffs and probabilities are separable: In the
context of a lottery, the subjective value of a prospective outcome (the payoff) is assumed to be independent of the
likelihood that the outcome will occur (the probability). In violation of this assumption, we present eight experiments
showing that people anticipate less utility from uncertain outcomes than from certain outcomes, even conditional on
their realization. The devaluation of uncertain outcomes is observed across different measures of utility (willingness
to spend money or time; choice between different options), different populations (student and online samples), and
different manipulations of uncertainty. We show that this result does not simply reflect a misunderstanding of the
instructions, or people’s aversion towards “weird“ transaction with unexplained features. We highlight the implications
of this phenomenon for empirical investigations of risk preferences, and conclude with a discussion of the psychological
mechanisms that might drive the devaluation of probabilistic outcomes."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

summary: "Would people report a different valuation for a 50 dollars Amazon gift card that is certain to be available,
and for the same gift card that has a 10% chance of being available? In violation of expected utility theory, we show
that people anticipate less utility from uncertain outcomes than from certain outcomes, even conditional on their
realization. We show that it isn't driven by beliefs about the quality the good (we always use gift cards, which are of
unambiguous quality), by a misunderstanding of the instructions, or by differences in “weirdness“ (Mislavsky and
Simonsohn 2018) between the transactions."
