abstract: 'Price knowledge is a key antecedent of many consumer judgments and decisions. This paper examines consumers’ 
ability to form accurate beliefs about the minimum, the maximum, and the overall variability of prices for multiple 
product categories. Eight experiments provide evidence for a novel phenomenon we call dispersion spillover: Consumers 
tend to overestimate price dispersion in a category after encountering another category in which prices are more 
dispersed (versus equally or less dispersed). Our experiments show that this dispersion spillover is consequential: 
It influences the likelihood that consumers will search for (and find) better prices and offers, and how much consumers 
bid in auctions. Finally, we disentangle two cognitive processes that might underlie dispersion spillover. Our results 
suggest that judgments of dispersion are not only based on specific prices stored in memory, and that dispersion 
spillover does not simply reflect the inappropriate activation of prices from other categories. Instead, it appears 
that consumers also form “intuitive statistics” of dispersion: Summary representations that encode the dispersion of 
prices in the environment, but that are insufficiently category-specific.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

summary: "Should I search for a cheaper flight? How much should I bid for the house? To answer those questions, consumers 
form beliefs about the dispersion of flight prices or house bids... but how accurate are those beliefs? We provide 
evidence for a phenomenon we call dispersion spillover: Seeing more (vs. less) dispersed prices in one category leads 
people to perceive more price dispersion in another category. This dispersion spillover influences consumers’ judgments 
of price attractiveness and changes their likelihood to search for (and find) better options."
